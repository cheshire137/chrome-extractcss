# extractCSS for Chrome

[extractCSS.com](http://extractcss.com) is an online tool which can extract IDs, classes and inline styles
from HTML document and output them as CSS stylesheet, built by Adnan Topal. I'm
building on [his work](https://github.com/adnantopal/extractcss) by writing a
Chrome extension to let you get a stubbed stylesheet for pages you visit.
